A repository for SEAFDEC training

## Setup

This project is set up with [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage package dependencies. Inside R (and with your working directory set correctly) run `renv::restore()`. Follow all prompts. This will install the correct versions of all the packages needed to replicate our results. Packages are installed in a stand-alone project library for this paper, and will not affect your installed R packages anywhere else. 



```{r}
library(sraplus)
library(LBSPR)
library(JABBA)
```
