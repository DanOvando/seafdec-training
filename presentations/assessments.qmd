## Why Is or Isn't This Enough?

$$
B_{t+1} = B_t \left(1 + r \left(1 + \frac{B_t}{K} \right) \right) - C_t
$$

$$
\frac{B_t}{BMSY} = \frac{B_t}{K/2}
$$

$$
MSY = \frac{rK}{4}
$$
$$
\frac{F_t}{FMSY} = \frac{C_t/B_t}{r/2}
$$

## Adding Model Complexity

- "All models are wrong but some are useful"

- Goal is the "least wrong" model?

- Why don't we use full ecosystem models for every assessment then? 

. . . 

goal is **least wrong model that your data and resources will support**

## Rough "Best Practices"

- Determine and process your data 
  - data must be representative of the stock

- Develop models linking data to population
  - Develop *competing* models as needed
  
- Decide how to weight your data

- Check for quality of fit
  - Convergence, uncertainty, model misspecification
  
- Compare alternative models

- Communicate all viable model results **and uncertainty**
